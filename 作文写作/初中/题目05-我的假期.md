我要去太阳度假。我将用宇宙飞船去那里。我要坐一个蓝色的宇宙飞船。然后我会驾驶飞船到太阳。太阳很热。所以我穿上超衬衫。早上，我会吃太阳汉堡作早餐。

八点我就可以和我的朋友那里玩耍了。他们是超级狗和超级女孩。狗是黑色和白色相间的。超级女孩很聪明。超级女生和超级狗喜欢和我玩。所以我和他们玩了四十分钟。然后我在我小小的红房子里的蓝色的小桌子上做我的功课。做完作业后，我就吃午餐。我会吃太阳沙拉。我会给太阳婴儿做一些红色的玩具熊。我会喝红色的果汁，红色的鱼和红色的米饭。所有的东西都是红色的。然后我需要大量的水因为在太阳上实在是太热了。所以我会步行到飞船，驾驶飞船回到地球。

这是一个在太阳上的愉快假期。
