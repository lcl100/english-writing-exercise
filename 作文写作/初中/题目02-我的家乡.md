## 我的家乡

### 范文一

My home town is a beautiful place. It stands beside a wide river and is rich in fish and rice. But in the old days it was a poor and backward little town. Many people had no work. They lived a hard life. In 1949 my hometown was liberated. Since then great changes have taken place there. The streets have been widened. Factories，schools, hospitals, cinemas and theaters have sprung up one after another. The life of the people is greatly improved. l love my hometown. All the more I love its people. They are working hard so as to make it still richer and more beautiful.



我的家乡是一个美丽的地方。它坐落在一条宽阔的河流旁边，盛产鱼和米饭。但是以前它是一个贫穷落后的小城镇。很多人都没有工作。他们过得很艰辛。1949年我的家乡解放了。自那以后发生了很大的变化。街道已拓宽。工厂，学校，医院，电影院和剧院如雨后春笋般涌现出来。人们的生活大大改善了。我爱我的家乡。我更爱那里的人。他们努力工作来让家乡变得更加的富裕和美丽。
