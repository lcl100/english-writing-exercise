In xiamen there is a park. It's a big and beautiful park. It has two gates. They are the north gate and the west gate. Many people park their bikes in front of the gates. There is a shop at the north gate. When you go into the park through the north gate，you will find a large square on your right and you will see lots of trees and flowers around you. In the west of the park, there is a playground. Sometimes some children fly kites on it and some people sit on the grass and chat. In the middle of the park,there is a lake. there are many boats on it. There is a hill in the east of the park. The park is very beautiful. I love it very much. Will you come to visit it some day?



在厦门有一个又大又漂亮的公园。它有两个大门。他们是北门和西门。许多人把自行车停在大门前。在北门有个商店。当你从北门进入公园的时候，你会发现在你的右边是一个大广场，你会看到你周围有很多花草树木。在公园的西边，有一个操场。有时有些孩子在操场上放风筝，一些人坐在草地上聊天。在公园的中间，有一个湖，湖上有许多船。在公园的东边有一座小山。公园很漂亮。我非常喜欢它。你会不会在未来的某一天过来参观它呢?
